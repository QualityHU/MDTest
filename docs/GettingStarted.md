Getting Started
==


#### Requirements.
* Visual Studio 2012 or 2013 with NuGet package manager.

#### Download NUnitBenchmarker solutions from GitHub.
You will need these repositories:
* https://github.com/Orcomp/NUnitBenchmarker

(Later NUnitBenchmarker will be available as Nuget package)

#### Building The Solution

You will need Nuget installed on your computer.

The first time you build the solution, Nuget will fetch the required packages. (If it fails to do this you may have to right click on the solution and enable "Nuget Restore".) and then rebuild the solution again. This time it should work.
